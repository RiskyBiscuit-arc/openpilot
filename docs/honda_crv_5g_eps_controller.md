# Honda CR-V 5G firmware-inversion lateral controller

This records the CR-V-specific calibration used to select the existing
`LatControlHondaEps` logic for `HONDA_CRV_5G`. It does not introduce another
control law: joining, fading, filtering, residual PID, firmware inversion,
driver override, and telemetry remain the Civic/Clarity implementation.

The firmware image and compact drive remain in the Honda firmware repository;
they are not runtime dependencies. The exact constants, fit result, hashes, and
reproduction tool are folded into this repository.

## Firmware calibration

The image supplies the exact nine-point command and P-gain tables used by the
controller calibration. It also supplies command clamp 1774, output scale 256,
and FeedforwardV1 Kff 45. OpenPilot's normalized lateral output currently maps
to 4096 E4 counts for the modified CR-V profile.

The calibrated image is the released Proper Torque Mod build owners flash:
`39990-TLA-A040_Clarity_FF_tune_telemety_8cf8e537.rwd` on the shared "Modded
Honda RWDs" Drive (39990-TLA-A040 / Proper Torque Mod), RWD SHA-256
`26f5390b654ace80b759bd20156d4c8ef834d97dc0e22889c2d247c052980afb`. It decodes
to the full image SHA-256 `d5dc04a8…` (application `8cf8e537`, normalization
1650), byte-identical to the `…_ff45_8cf8e537_DO_NOT_FLASH_full.bin` build
artifact named above.

Route `00000006--82bb552a2c` was recorded on an earlier test build, application
`t9-67523237` (retained as `00-active/evidence/artifacts/39990-TLA-A040-t9-67523237-DO_NOT_FLASH.rwd`
in the firmware repository), whose feedback normalization reads 1450 at `0x429A0`.
It is used only for that drive's normalization; nothing from it ships.
A least-squares fit of the EPS's own V5 `feedback_R6` on `steeringRateDeg`,
hands off, gives `-121.6051` counts/(degree/s) at a 15 ms lag (tracker-1),
R² 0.977 over 15,966 samples. Normalization is a pure scale on R6, so the FF45
image (1650) gets `-121.6051 * 1650 / 1450 = -138.378`. Tracker alpha changes
phase but not that DC gain.

Superseded (D-091 → D-093): `-105.70439496 * 1650 / 1450 = -120.284`. That was a
single R6/rate ratio, which the tracker lag biases low (the median ratio on the
same drive is -114). Independent firmware cross-check: the motor-to-linear-angle
constant (u16 3121 at `0x19C00`) is shared with every Civic-family image, so R6
scales with the A-table centre divisor (16783 here vs the Clarity's 16384),
predicting -136 to -142 at norm 1650.

## CR-V load fit

Run, on the native-rate extraction (schema `honda-crv-eps-autotune-v2`):

```bash
python tools/lateral/fit_crv_eps_load.py /path/to/drive-82bb552a2c-native-v5.json --drive-norm 1450
```

Input SHA-256 (compressed, as retained in the firmware repository's
`30-hardware/vehicle-evidence/replay-imports/`):
`8b94a3439b6f7fdeeea0f1bb32a9c0a8037637441c01b15af41fde0cb9fdedd7`.

The fit uses 40,193 V5 groups with speed above 2 m/s, lateral control active,
active command, no steering press, driver torque below 400, and the hands-off Q8
scale of 256. It is evaluated in the controller's own units: speed in m/s, the
steering angle with liveParameters' angle offset removed (as `column_load`
receives the desired angle), and liveParameters roll. Its target is the firmware
output reported by the V5 telemetry:

```text
load = -7.29446 * angle
       -0.143159 * angle * speed^2
       -4.60337 * angle_rate
       -297.83 * tanh(angle_rate / 5)
       -19.899
       -3.58048 * roll * speed^2
```

R² 0.843; alternating 60-second block holdouts 0.857 and 0.820.

Superseded (D-091 → D-093): the fit of the 10 Hz compact drive,
`(-9.09927, -0.0225716, -5.24359, -259.312, -55.7274, 0)`. The compact `speed`
field is mph (`extract_drives.py` writes `vEgo * 2.23694`), so that k1 was per
mph² and 5.0x too weak in the controller's m/s; the raw angle folded the -0.69°
median angle offset into the bias; and roll was absent. Evaluated as the
controller uses it on this drive, the old set scores R² 0.65, and above 25 m/s
its error is 181 counts RMS against a mean |output| of 174 (110 for the new set).

## Runtime boundary

`NrdrLatEpsFirmwareFF` remains the gate. On a modified CR-V it now selects the
same controller class as the Civic/Clarity, but with `CRV_5G_A040_FF45`, the
CR-V load fit, and neutral P/I multipliers because the CR-V CarParams already
carry their speed-scheduled gains. No added command delay is used: route
`00000013--da43527a2c` measured the normal-PID CR-V approximately 0.08 seconds
late, so copying the Civic/Clarity delay would move in the wrong direction.

This is static, unit, and offline telemetry evidence. It is not a road test of
the controller, current FF45 firmware, firmware VGR, or the closed steering loop.

## Current-device firmware confirmation

After the implementation, the comma at `192.168.20.80` was inspected read-only.
Route `00000037--2683763b26`, segment 56 (logged OpenPilot commit
`c12c15fd2350972befede744a7e302d4737dd106`, rlog SHA-256
`2737eaa5e7eb98c0d0dc90b722f378bba29e41e5eb1ff00fde785892226b7fd5`)
contains 2,900 complete nonzero V5 telemetry groups. The measured term added
between `pd_out` and the scaled pre-clamp output matches `45 * reference_R5 /
1024`: correlation 0.99865, fitted slope 0.99929, intercept -0.725 count, RMS
5.74 counts, and 95th-percentile absolute error below one count. This confirms
that Kff 45 is running in the owner's EPS, not merely present in the retained
firmware artifact.

A same-timestamp exploratory load refit across nine segments was deliberately
not adopted: per-segment holdout R² ranged from 0.33 to 0.91 because EPS output
leads the resulting wheel motion and requires the extractor's alignment model.
The aligned compact-drive fit above remains canonical until the current route is
run through that complete alignment pipeline.

The comma was still at source commit `87d17c83d97e6cbad9f2ecc7ed02613164e16ee9`
when inspected, with `NrdrLatEpsFirmwareFF=True` and
`NrdrLatUseFirmwareVgr=False`. The new controller commit was not installed or
road-tested during this inspection.
